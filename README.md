## Description: 
I have recently been approached by a medium-sized international retailer who is keen on elevating their business intelligence practices. With operations spanning across different regions, they've accumulated large amounts of sales from disparate sources over the years.

Recognizing the value of this data, they aim to transform it into actionable insights for better decision-making. Your goal is to use Microsoft Power BI to design a comprehensive Quarterly report. This will involve extracting and transforming data from various origins, designing a robust data model rooted in a star-based schema, and then constructing a multi-page report.

The report will present a high-level business summary tailored for C-suite executives, and also give insights into their highest value customers segmented by sales region, provide a detailed analysis of top-performing products categorised by type against their sales targets, and a visually appealing map visual that spotlights the performance metrics of their retail outlets across different territories.

## Data Modelling; 
Star Schemea was used as the structure for the data analysis as it was the most efficient model for the data
